# Repeat-Project-Full-Stack-Development

Hello, my name is Al-Azeem and this is, thankfully, my last Full Stack Development project. This is a repeat assignment I had to do over the summer of 2024 and it was a miserable experience to say the least. I tried doing this with a positive mindset, but that was a waste of effort because this module was a freaking nightmare. Just thinking about it really bothers me...
Couldn't add the node modules because I had way more than 100.
